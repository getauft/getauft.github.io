— Mom, where are my blue pants?
— Check in your room.
— No, they’re not there.
— Then look on the ironing board.
— OK. Here they are! Mom!
— Yes, Chin, what is it now?
— Sorry, but I can’t find my sneakers.
— I’m sure you know where they are. Just think for a minute.
— Oh! Now I see them. I guess you’re right.
— Of course I am. I’m your mother.
— Well, then tell me where my car keys are.
— How about in your coat pocket?
— No!
— Maybe they’re in your gym bag.
— Great! They’re here. Thanks, Mom. See you later!
— Bye! Someday he’s going to lose his head!
